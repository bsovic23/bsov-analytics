Texas Needs Assessment

1. Analyze Two Tabs of Data
2. Create pre-coding for the qualitative survey (results will come mid june)

- Look at trends among the 40 counties, ESRD rates specifically
- Some counties worse than others
- Tiers represent differences (border county, transplant county etc...)
- The purpose of this analysis is to be provided as a report at the end of project timeline
- Map of tiers maybe ?
- Show texas why programs are needed
