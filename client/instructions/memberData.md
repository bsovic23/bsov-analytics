V3.0
- [] Change the data regarding the profession to using the variable that doesnt have the undefinied variables
- [] Number of active members by year for the past 24 months
        * Maybe highlight the years different from pre vs post wild apricot to show growth started once salesforce thing fixed
- [] Add the variables used for each of the data tabs
- [] Determine List of undefined professions
- [] Lapsed members by year add the graphs
- [] Q/Q Fiscal year analysis rather than the 3 month intervals for a calendar year
        * Need to change the FY to what the acutal fiscal year is not just 3 month period
- [] active year join broken down by count per month and profession
- [] add extra row to the last login to store historical counts (since each month someone can update their last login)

V4.0 
- [] Ad ons broken down by FY
        * Explanation: Theres no date of when these are added, so the only thing i could do with this is what year memberSince vs add ons?
- [] Pull a list per profession of people who have been active in the last 4-5 years but havent renewed
- [] Re Run using data from 12/31

- [] Check the add on counts
- [] find some talking points for jordan to discuss the 'pros'
