Affinia Analysis

-----------------------------
1. To Do Analysis
-----------------------------
V6.0 i think all done
* [x] % change for medications, A1C, BP, etc metrics (row 74)
* [x] Demographic Analysis for those who did not complete a test result (row 121)
* [x] Check CKD Analysis 

V7.0
* [x] Bre Email
* [x] Of people who had UACR results but no egfr, what is the percent of people who had normal vs abnoral for the quant test (slack thread Katelyn Question)
* [x] Question regarding age groups, (slack thread Katelyn Question) she said there is a table from healthy.io that has it broken out in age groups
* [x] Megan Email 11/14: confirm how many of the uacr results came back as abnormal (the tests)

V8.0
* [x] 11/14 G1 - 5 and A1 -3 Table Katelyn Email
* [x] Potentially doing the payer type analysis if katelyn says can emial affinia for payer information

V9.0
* [x] Zipcode Analysis - Top 5 Zips 
* [] Zipcode Analysis - Social Determinants of Health
* [x] Financial Class Analysis
* [x] Re do the table with the financial class numbers (because the sheet Bre sent does not line up maybe? )
* [x] Ethnicity Analysis - Completed vs Non Completed Test
* [X] Re-do table with just follow up people (rather than if had a test result) (ROW 177 TABLE)
* [] Table with CKD Diagnosis / labs re-do the table with just follow up people (just check to confirm only those with follow up visits)

V10.0
* [x] Can you help me calculate median age of the non completers and completers? Is there a significant difference between the two?  (Katelyn 12/16 email -> document attached)

* [x] Quick Q for you- On comparison of completers/non completers- A couple potentially significant differences that I see on first glance, can you let me know if any of these are statistically significant? (Katelyn 12/23 email)
    * [x] •	larger percentage of hispanic (5% vs 2%) and spanish speaking (10% vs 6%) patients completed the home test.
    * [x] •	Larger percentage of individuals with commercial/Private insurance (27% vs 21%) completed the test. 
* [x] I'm trying to figure out what to do with the zip code analysis. First, can we add a percentage of patients in each of the top 5 zip codes instead of just a number? That will help to more easily see if there is a difference in location of completers/non completers I think. 
* [x] Distance from an affinia site could also be interesting- did more people who live farther from the clinic complete the test?

V11.0

2. To Do Clean Up
-----------------------------

* [] Clean up unneccessary functions
* [] Add individual index.js for each import rather than one index.js that holds all of the exported const
* [] After creating individual index.js need to reformat all the functions/page to handle the new locations of data
