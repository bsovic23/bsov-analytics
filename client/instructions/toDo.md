To Do

-----------------------------
1. Analysis/Code To Do
-----------------------------

* Affinia Data Sheet Updates
    - Analysis Methods Updates if Megan/Katelyn send back needing feedback
    - Bre MRN Emails [] Email 1    [] Email 2
    - Potentially doing the payer type analysis if katelyn says can emial affinia for payer information

    **** ONES THAT DID NOT HAVE A UACR RESULT (2 LISTS, 68 AND 91??)

    - I think this is pretty good. I'm going to weave it into the narrative of the paper for now. Once we have more of a complete manuscript with results, discussion, etc. we can do some editing to make it longer or shorter. 

    - Lines 34-35 where you list eGFR>90 but missing uACR, eGFR >60-89 but missing uACR, and missing eGFR. Can you please clarify the cohorts or denominators for those numbers. The two missing uACR lines (34 and 35) add up to 661 people which is more than the total that had follow-up appointments and lab testing. Is this data from a larger pool of patients than just the cohort that had abnormal results and follow-up visits? If yes can we rerun these numbers with just the cohort that had f/u visits. 

    - And with that question, can you confirm that lines 25-32 are reflective of just the patients who had follow-up appoints after an abnormal uACR. 

    - And lastly, is it possible to do some analysis of just the follow-up uACR results. All of the people in that cohort should be people that had an abnormal uACR in the home tests correct? What percentage of those that got a follow-up uACR completed had an abnormal result?

    - Add ethnicity (since race and ethnicity are two seperate datasets)  (HISPANIC VS NON HISPNIHC) AND 
    DO THE ANALYSIS FOR ALL, COMPLETED TEST, NON COMPLETED TEST, NORMAL, ABNORMAL TEST

    * WHAT PERCENT OF THE TEST RESULTS CAME ABOVE 30 FOR UACR VALUES (SO COMPARING UACR RESULT VS TEST RESULT)
        TO SEEING IF ABRNOMAL TEST RESULT AS WELL AS >30 FOR UACR
    *  well as comparing the A1 A2 A3 vs test resutls
    * Zip code analysis by complete

* Sandra Patient Portal
    - Update code to include ICF id new doc Sandra sent
    - Update code to re order to registration, icf, core, eq5d5l
    - Keep batch last run variable so that combo data can track what is the most recent that the data was run/pulled
    - Core, EQ5D5L multitple surveys which are filled out every 6 months
        - Re code to address the multiple surveys
        - Add variables for 'complete on time vs lapsed missing' if survey should be filled out but missing by 6 month date + 1 month late
    - Include email because data could be used for contact lists for pharma
    - Create variable to assess retention

* W.A Document Updates (+ WA Dashboard create)
    - Updates to do included in membership instructions doc

-----------------------------
2. Other To Do
-----------------------------

* Update Goals Sheet

-----------------------------
3. Code Maintenance To Do
-----------------------------

* Seperate BSOV Analytics / NKF Analytics Dashboard
* Seperate the AFFINIA data into seperate folders (which should make maintanence easier)
